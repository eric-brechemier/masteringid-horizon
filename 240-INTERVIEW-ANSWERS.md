## Answers from the interviews

The answers come from different interviews lead with Horizon employees.
They have been grouped by topic and reworded to preserve anonymity.

### Security Breach

It was just a single incident last year, but this was a disaster,
not only from the donors impacted by increased credit card risk, but
also for the Horizon Foundation, which was put in a very bad light
and lost future donations and goodwill from those affected and other
potential donors.

This event is affecting the trust in the organization, which is, at its core,
the foundation for all of its charity work. The organization needs to work
hard to do a better job of protecting its donors and regain the public trust.

Phishing attacks and security threats in general targeting similar NGOs
have increased dramatically over the past few years. Most donations are
now handled over the Internet, with donor details tracked in large databases,
instead of using cheques sent by mail and paper records traditionally.
Knowing that the donors are naturally generous, and susceptible to give
to the causes that they empathize with, makes their contact details
especially attractive to scammers.

An aggravating factor is that an increasing portion of the organization is now
working remotely as a consequence of the pandemic. A lot of employees and
volunteers alike require access to sensitive information, because understanding
our donors is at the heart of all of the fundraising efforts. Each additional
remote access is a potential entry point for hackers, which must be secured
under the shared responsibility of the individual and the organization.

Some of these attacks are particularly insidious, because they masquerade
as a familiar person or computer system to take advantage of members of
the organization to extract information or make them perform actions
unwittingly. The organization is entrusted with the personal information
and money of the donors to serve its charitable purpose. This requires
extra care and awareness of the potential threats.

### Email Usage

Email is the primary communication channel within the organization and
between the organization and its partners. Sensitive information is usually
discussed over the phone, but it is not always convenient due to the
differences in time zones.

### Learners

Employees have widely different levels of mastery of technology. Why the
youngest employees or those with a higher level of education are very familiar
with digital tools and somewhat aware of the security threats, this is not
the case of the majority of the workforce.

### Security Skills

Employees need to recognize phishing emails and other security threats.
They need to follow security procedures to keep their passwords and other
credentials safe. They need to recognize when a prompt for their password
is expected and normal from when it is unexpected or suspicious. They need
to pay attention to changes in the Web pages and IT systems they interact
with, and report unexpected events to the technical team for analysis.
They need to detect inconsistencies in emails. They need to check URLs
before and after they click on a link in an email, and before they enter
any password in a Web page. They need to recognize relevant parts of a URL,
notably where the domain name starts and ends.

They need to confirm any request for sensitive information or money transfer
through two different channels, e.g. email and phone or texts.

### Training History

Employees follow a mandatory security training during their onboarding.
It lasts for 30 minutes and is evaluated with a final quiz.

### Security Policy

The IT teams has procedures in place for password management and expected
email usage. It has also issued guidelines with best practices on how to
recognize different kinds of scam messages.

The IT department has identified weaknesses in the network security, which
have been corrected. Security software has been deployed and existing
applications have been upgraded to apply latest security patches.

### New Training Project

The stakeholders of the project is a joint task force of IT and HR,
associated with a team of enthusiastic employees from Operations
willing to take part in a pilot.

### Learning Outcome

The training should prevent future breaches and help to detect them faster.
The end goal is to avoid leaks of personal information and loss of money
and goodwill through scams and loss of public trust.

The training should start in priority with the employees with the highest
security privileges, who have regular access to sensitive information
or financial operations.

### Training Support from Management

Managers need to give employees the tools to recognize threats.
They also need to give them support to report any suspicious activity,
without the fear of sanctions.
