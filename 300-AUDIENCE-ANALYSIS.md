# Audience Analysis

## Introduction

We have sent surveys to healthcare personnel of the Horizon Foundation
in order to assess how they relate to the Security Breach which occurred
last year, and how they perceive their ability to fight phishing and
other digital threats in the course of their daily job.

## Overview of the Study

We received 7,500 responses to our survey, and we interviewed 60 employees
with different backgrounds among those who volunteered to answer more detailed
questions as a follow-up to the survey.

A number of profiles emerged from this study, by grouping people with similar
answers. We will describe below the three main profiles, which represent more
than two thirds of the respondents:

1. Nurse, 35, Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 5 times a day from Phone
2. Chief Nurse, 45, Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 3 times a day from Phone
3. Doctor, 40, Not Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 2 times a day from Computer

## Themes of Study

### Awareness of Security Threats

65% of the respondents were aware of the data breach. Still, one year later,
more than half of the respondents do not know or are not sure of which
procedures to follow to avoid security breaches when opening emails.

While most employees are convinced of the importance of digital safety
procedures, and willing to put them into practice, they are not sufficiently
aware of the best practices and procedures to follow. The positive attitude
towards digital safety, and the high level of education among these employees
are two factors expected to contribute to the success of a future training in
this domain.

### Technical Environment

Less than 10% of respondents check their emails from a computer, while
3 in 4 check their emails from a phone. The training received by employees
during onboarding used to describes procedures to open emails safely when
using a computer. This creates a discrepancy with the context where these
procedures must be applied when reading email from a phone or tablet.

The training would benefit from being applied in its actual context of use,
while reading emails in the course of regular activities. The onboarding
training shall be updated to reflect mainstream usage for email consumption.

### Focus on People, Not Data

During the interviews, we noticed that the problem of security threats
was considered with more empathy when the emphasis was put on the people
affected, the donors and the recipients of the organization charity efforts,
rather than the protection of computer systems, networks and computers.

Field employees have little time to spare for technical audits. But they
have shown a readiness to give some thought to the consequences of unwittingly
lending a helping hand to a remote attacker in their attempt to take advantage
of people's trust in the Horizon Foundation.
