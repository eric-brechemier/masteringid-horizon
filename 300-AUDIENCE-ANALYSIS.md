# 3. Audience Analysis

## Introduction

We have sent surveys to healthcare personnel of the Horizon Foundation.
Our goal was to assess how they relate to the security breach which occurred
last year. We also analyzed how employees perceive their ability to fight
phishing and other digital threats in the course of their daily job.

## Overview of the Study

We received 7,500 responses to our survey. We then interviewed 60 employees
with different backgrounds, among those who volunteered to answer more detailed
questions as a follow-up to the survey.

We analyzed answers and a number of profiles emerged when grouping them
by similarity. We will describe below the three main profiles, which
represent more than two thirds of the respondents:

1. [Nurse, 35, Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 5 times a day from Phone](310-nurse-persona.pdf)
2. [Chief Nurse, 45, Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 3 times a day from Phone](311-chief-nurse-persona.pdf)
3. [Doctor, 40, Not Aware of Breach, Checks Emails 2 times a day from Computer](312-doctor-persona.pdf)

## Themes of Study

### Awareness of Security Threats

65% of the respondents were aware of the data breach. Still, one year later,
the awareness of the procedures to avoid security breaches is low. Over half
of the respondents do not know or are unsure of which procedures to follow.

*Most employees are convinced of the importance of digital safety procedures,
and willing to put them into practice. But they are not sufficiently aware of
the best practices and procedures to follow. The positive attitude towards
digital safety, and the high level of education among these employees are two
factors expected to contribute to the success of a future training.*

### Technical Environment

Less than 10% of respondents check their emails from a computer, while
3 in 4 check their emails from a phone. The training received by employees
during onboarding focused on computer usage to describe procedures to open
emails safely. This creates a discrepancy with the context where these
procedures must be applied, using a phone or tablet during field work.

*The training would benefit from being applied in its actual context of use,
while reading emails in the course of regular activities. The onboarding
training shall be updated to reflect mainstream usage for email consumption.*

### Focus on People, Not Data

During the interviews, we noticed that the problem of security threats
was considered with more empathy when we shifted the focus to people
rather than data. Employees felt more involved with the issue when we
talked about their effects on the people affected, the donors and the
recipients of the organization charity efforts, rather than the protection
of computer systems, networks and computers.

*Field employees have little time to spare for technical audits. But they
have shown a readiness to give some thought to the consequences of unwittingly
lending a helping hand to a remote attacker. Their motivation is to fend off
any attempts to take advantage of the people who trust the Horizon Foundation.*
