p. 50  

> (…) Terms like “behavioral objective,” “performance objective,”
> and “learning objective” were not used by curriculum specialists
> early in the Twentieth Century. However, you only have to read
> through the work of Bobbit (1918, 1924) and Charters (1923,
> 1929; Charters and Waples, 1929) to relieve any doubt that these
> educators would have been very comfortable with such terms.
> Ammons (1969) credits Charters and Bobbit with formulating a
> method for determining educational objectives on a *scientific*
> basis. As a potential instructional designer, you owe it to yourself
> to spend a few evenings reading some of these early works. If you
> are not humbled by this experience, at least, you will be
> enlightened.

> However, it is Tyler (1934, 1950, 1964) who is most often
> identified as the “father” of today's performance objective.
> Beginning in the 1920's (Dale, 1967; Lindvall, 1964), Tyler's
> behavioral approach to test construction undoubtedly stimulated
> his interest in behaviorally stated objectives for students. But
> Charters' influences on Tyler was also apparent somewhat earlier,
> in Tyler's dissertation (Dale, 1967). The linkage between behaviorally
> stated objectives and carefully constructed tests to measure
> those behaviors was one of the many contributions Tyler made to
> instructional systems analysis. (…)
