> UNICEF, the UN World Food and the UN Development programs.


> Experts noticed that the threat actors employed several
> noteworthy techniques in this campaign, such as the ability
> to detect mobile devices and to log keystrokes.
>
> Attackers deployed a Javascript code on the phishing pages
> that is able to determine if the user is accessing the page
> with a mobile device and delivers mobile specially-crafted content.

> The experts also collected evidence of keylogging functionality
> embedded in the password field of the phishing login pages.
> After the victims provided their credentials to bogus Office 365 login forms,
> the sites display customized pages to show that the users successfullyâ€™
> log into their accounts.

> The sites used in the campaign use SSL certificates to appear as legitimate Microsoft Office 365 login pages.
