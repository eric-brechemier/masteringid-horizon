# Instructional Analysis

## Summary of Needs Assessment

### Goal

Reduce the number of donors affected by the leak of
financial or Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
to less than 1,000 per year.

### Gap

Last year, 45,000 donors were affected by the leak of
financial records and PII. This is a gap of 44,000 donors
over what would be acceptable per year under this goal.

### Impact & Priority

This gap caused a loss of reputation and a loss of trust,
resulting in a loss of funds for the organization, due to
reduced repeat donations and less efficient fundraising campaigns.

Reaching the goal has been given a high priority by the management board,
and this importance has been communicated to the employees and the volunteers.
