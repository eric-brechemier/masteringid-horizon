# Instructional Analysis

## Goal

Reduce the number of donors affected by the leak of
financial or Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
to less than 1,000 per year.

## Gap

Last year, 45,000 donors were affected by the leak of
financial records and PII. This is a gap of 44,000 donors
over what would be acceptable per year under this goal.
