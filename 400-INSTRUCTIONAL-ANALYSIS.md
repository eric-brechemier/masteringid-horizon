## <a id="part1"/>Summary of Needs Assessment

### Goal

Reduce the number of donors affected by the leak of
financial or Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
to less than 1,000 per year.

### Gap

Last year, 45,000 donors were affected by the leak of
financial records and PII. This is a gap of 44,000 donors
over what would be acceptable per year under this goal.

### Impact & Priority

This gap caused a loss of reputation and a loss of trust,
resulting in a loss of funds for the organization, due to
reduced repeat donations and less efficient fundraising campaigns.

Reaching the goal has been given a high priority by the management board,
and this importance has been communicated to the employees and the volunteers.

## <a id="part2"/>Tasks Expected from Horizon Employees

### Preventing Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

In order to reach the goal, Horizon employees need to:

* Prevent unauthorized access to financial information of donors
* Prevent unauthorized access to names and personal details of donors.

This requires to know:

* where sensitive information is stored
* how to restrict its access
* what is a legitimate purpose to access sensitive information
* how to replace sensitive information with aggregates or anonymous information
  when sensitive details is not necessary for the task.

### Preventing Exploits of Employee Privileges Through Phishing

In order to fend off phishing attempts, Horizon employees must:

* *not* provide credentials to untrusted sources
* *not* run programs sent by untrusted sources
* *not* follow instructions of untrusted sources
* confirm any unexpected request received by email through a different chan
* discard or report any suspicious email
* ignore and close pop-up messages unrelated to your current activity
* refuse to run any associated program or script when opening an attachment.

They may also:
* configure a password manager to provide credentials only to trusted sources

This requires to know how to:

* differentiate phishing emails from legitimate work emails
* differentiate trusted from untrusted web pages
* differentiate trusted from untrusted senders of emails
* differentiate expected from unexpected requests for credentials
* differentiate expected from unexpected pop-up windows and notifications
* differentiate an attachment including executable code from a static file.

### Subgoal: Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

#### Behavior: Keep track of where sensitive donor information is stored

##### Practice

* Find all files and databases where **donor names** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor emails** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor phone numbers** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor addresses** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **credit card details** of donors are stored
* Find all files and databases where **bank details** of donors are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donation history** of donors is stored.

##### Minimum Information

* Where donor information is first stored when they provide it
* Who has access to donor information, and for what purpose
* Where donor information is stored for subsequent usage.
