## 6.1 Performance Assessment

The effectiveness of the training will be assessed at two different levels:
the individual learners and the organization.

### Individual Mastery

Individual employees and volunteers who take part in this training effort
will not be evaluated on a comparative scale. The objective of this training
is not to rank employees based on their understanding of the threats and
the defensive procedures.

The two main goals are:

1. helping learners to gain a growing appreciation for the threats,
leading them to favor caution in their digital interactions and
consistently avoid behaviors that put the organization at risk, and

2. gaining mastery, through regular practice, of the skills required
to fight off phishing scams and other digital threats.

A change in attitude is notoriously hard to evaluate, since answers provided
to a survey only partially predict the preferred behaviors when learners are
faced to the actual situation. The most accurate assessment would thus
involve observations of learners over extended periods of time. This would
prove both costly and intrusive in this case, since phishing emails come at
unpredictable times and are mixed with private communication.

We would thus recommend to evaluate this change of attitude informally,
through interviews with learning champions at the level of each department,
rather than trying to quantify it for each individual learner. We will
describe the learning champions and their recruitment in more details in
the [Learning Journey](620-LEARNING-JOURNEY.md).

Individual mastery of anti-phishing skills will be evaluated by sending
made-up scam emails at random intervals during the year. These emails will
be sorted in 3 levels of difficulty:

* at level 1, the email contains several obvious signs of scam
* at level 2, the email contains only one obvious sign of scam
* at level 3, the email is suspicious without any obvious sign of scam

All learners will start with a majority of emails from level 1.
Learners who fall into the trap set by an email will be redirected
to remedial information, earning useful information instead of putting
the organization at risk. These errors will be treated as an integral part
of the learning process, and no-one shall be held accountable for failing
these tests. The remedial learning material may be read immediately,
or downloaded and printed for future reference.

After successfully avoiding traps of a certain level about 5 to 10 times,
learners will get upgraded to the next level of challenge, with a majority
of emails at that new level of difficulty.

We propose to set the following goals after one year:

- more than 90% of learners at level 2 or above,
- at least 10% of learners at level 3.

### Assessment of the Organization

While individual learners will be tested through carefully doctored emails,
crafted using predictable techniques, the organization as a whole does not
have that luxury. In order to protect itself against upcoming threats of
growing complexity, it must be evaluated against yet unexpected threats.

This will be done by hiring external consultants, called penetration testers,
or pen testers in short, to try its defenses and report any vulnerabilities
they identify, without taking advantage of it. We recommend to work with
certified penetration testers part of a well-established cybersecurity agency,
to be selected at a later stage of the project.

This evaluation shall be done at least once per year, with further
recommendations being implemented and deployed progressively, based
on the severity of the threat, over the next 6 months.

In addition, an internal committee shall evaluate the actions led during
the year to raise awareness of issues related to digital threats. A one page
summary of this evaluation shall be included in the annual report of the
organization published online for donors and the general public.
