## Performance Objectives

For the definition of these performance objectives, we are using the
framework introduced by Robert M. Gagn√© and Leslie J. Briggs in
*Principles of Instructional Design*.  Each performance objective
is described in a sentence with the following structure:

  * **Situation:** Given the input and materials at the start of the activity,
  * the learner
  * **Capability Verb:**
     - DISCRIMINATES (*Intellectual Skill: Discrimination*)
     - IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)
     - CLASSIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)
     - DEMONSTRATES (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)
     - GENERATES (*Intellectual Skill: Higher-order Rule or Problem Solving*)
     - ORIGINATES (*Cognitive Strategy*)
     - STATES (*Verbal Information*)
     - EXECUTES (*Motor Skills*)
     - CHOOSES (*Attitude*)
  * **Object:** the observable outcome
  * **Action:** by performing the observable activity
  * **(Optional) Tools and other constraints:** using the provided tools and procedures
       in a suitable manner.

In this framework, the major capability verbs reflect the corresponding domain
of learning. This is an alternative to Bloom's taxonomy.

### Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

#### Keep track of where donor data is stored

Given access to Horizon network, shared files and databases,  
the IT specialist  
IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)  
the files and databases which contain sensitive donor data  
by writing a list of their names and locations,  
with the number of records and the names and types of the sensitive details contained in each.

#### Restrict access to donor data

#### Identify legitimate reasons to access data


### Prevent Exploitation of Employee Privileges through Phishing Scams

#### Do not provide credentials to untrusted sources

#### Do not run programs from untrusted sources

#### Report suspicious emails for analysis

#### Confirm unexpected email requests by phone
