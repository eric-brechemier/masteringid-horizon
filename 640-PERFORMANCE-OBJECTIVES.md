## Performance Objectives

For the definition of these performance objectives, we are using the
framework introduced by Robert M. Gagn√© and Leslie J. Briggs in
*Principles of Instructional Design*.  Each performance objective
is described in a sentence with the following structure:

  * **Situation:** Given the input and materials at the start of the activity,
  * the learner
  * **Capability Verb:**
     - DISCRIMINATES (*Intellectual Skill: Discrimination*)
     - IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)
     - CLASSIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)
     - DEMONSTRATES (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)
     - GENERATES (*Intellectual Skill: Higher-order Rule or Problem Solving*)
     - ORIGINATES (*Cognitive Strategy*)
     - STATES (*Verbal Information*)
     - EXECUTES (*Motor Skills*)
     - CHOOSES (*Attitude*)
  * **Object:** the observable outcome
  * **Action:** by performing the observable activity
  * **(Optional) Tools and other constraints:** using the provided tools and procedures
       in a suitable manner.

In this framework, the major capability verbs reflect the corresponding domain
of learning. This is an alternative to Bloom's taxonomy.

### Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

#### Keep track of where sensitive donor data is stored

Given access to Horizon network, shared files and databases,  
the IT specialist  
IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)  
the files and databases which contain sensitive donor data  
by writing a list of their names and locations,  
with the number of records and the names and types of the sensitive details contained in each.

#### Restrict access to donor data

Given a list of files and databases, and a list of select Horizon employees  
the IT specialist  
EXECUTES (*Motor Skills*)  
restricting access to the files and databases exclusively to the selected employees  
by using Horizon IT software utilities with administrator privileges.

#### Identify legitimate reasons to access sensitive donor data

Given a reason to request access to a file or database
with sensitive donor information,  
the IT specialist  
CLASSIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)  
whether the reason is legitimate or not  
by stating the use of the data
which cannot be fulfilled without access to the sensitive information,  
or if the reason is not legitimate,  
by proposing an alternative means to achieve the expected result without sensitive data.


### Prevent Exploitation of Employee Privileges through Phishing Scams

#### Do not provide credentials to untrusted sources

Given an email received from an unknown contact in the course of daily activities,  
with a URL which opens a login page similar to the one on Horizon extranet,  
the Horizon employee or volunteer  
IDENTIFIES (Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept)  
the login form as unexpected and suspicious  
by not typing their password in the suspicious form  
at any point.

#### Do not run programs from untrusted sources

Given an email received from an unknown contact in the course of daily activities,  
with an attached file which is executable on the computer from which the email is read  
the Horizon employee or volunteer  
IDENTIFIES (Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept)  
the attached file as executable and suspicious  
by not allowing it to run on the computer  
at any point.

#### Report suspicious emails for analysis

Given an email received from an unknown contact in the course of daily activities  
with tell-tale signs that make it suspicious (an unusual tone or language or an unexpected request)  
the Horizon employee or volunteer  
DEMONSTRATES (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)  
that they are aware of Horizon policy to report suspicious emails  
by forwarding it for analysis  
to the dedicated email address publicized on posters for that purpose,  
within 2 business days after receiving the email.

#### Confirm unexpected email requests by phone

Given an email received from a known contact in the course of daily activities  
with tell-tale signs that make it suspicious (an unusual tone or urgency or an unexpected request)  
the Horizon employee or volunteer  
DEMONSTRATES (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)  
that they are aware of Horizon policy to double-check unexpected requests received by email  
by calling the contact to confirm the request  
using the phone number published for that contact in Horizon directory  
within 1 business day after receiving the email.
