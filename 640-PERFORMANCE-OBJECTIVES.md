## Performance Objectives

For the definition of these performance objectives, we are using the
framework introduced by Robert M. Gagn√© and Leslie J. Briggs in
*Principles of Instructional Design*.  Each performance objective
is described in a sentence with the following structure:

  * **Situation:** Given the input and materials at the start of the activity,
  * the learner
  * **Capability Verb:**
     - DISCRIMINATES (*Intellectual Skill: Discrimination*)
     - IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)
     - CLASSIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)
     - DEMONSTRATES (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)
     - GENERATES (*Intellectual Skill: Higher-order Rule or Problem Solving*)
     - ORIGINATES (*Cognitive Strategy*)
     - STATES (*Verbal Information*)
     - EXECUTES (*Motor Skills*)
     - CHOOSES (*Attitude*)
  * **Object:** the observable outcome
  * **Action:** by performing the observable activity
  * **(Optional) Tools and other constraints:** using the provided tools and procedures
       in a suitable manner.

In this framework, the major capability verbs reflect the corresponding domain
of learning. This is an alternative to Bloom's taxonomy.

### Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

#### Keep track of where donor data is stored

Given access to Horizon network, shared files and databases,  
the IT specialist  
IDENTIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)  
the files and databases which contain sensitive donor data  
by writing a list of their names and locations,  
with the number of records and the names and types of the sensitive details contained in each.

#### Restrict access to donor data

Given a list of files and databases, and a list of select Horizon employees  
the IT specialist  
EXECUTES (*Motor Skills*)  
restricting access to the files and databases exclusively to the selected employees  
by using Horizon IT software utilities with administrator privileges.

#### Identify legitimate reasons to access sensitive donor data

Given a reason to request access to a file or database
with sensitive donor information,  
the IT specialist  
CLASSIFIES (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)  
whether the reason is legitimate or not  
by stating the use of the data
which cannot be fulfilled without access to the sensitive information,  
or if the reason is not legitimate,  
by proposing an alternative means to achieve the expected result without sensitive data.


### Prevent Exploitation of Employee Privileges through Phishing Scams

#### Do not provide credentials to untrusted sources



#### Do not run programs from untrusted sources

#### Report suspicious emails for analysis

#### Confirm unexpected email requests by phone
