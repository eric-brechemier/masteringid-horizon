## Performance Objectives

For the definition of these performance objectives, we are using the
framework introduced by Robert M. Gagn√© and Leslie J. Briggs in
*Principles of Instructional Design*.  Each performance objective
is described in a sentence with the following structure:

  * **Situation:** Given the input and materials at the start of the activity,
  * the learner
  * **Capability Verb:**
     - discriminates (*Intellectual Skill: Discrimination*)
     - identifies (*Intellectual Skill: Concrete Concept*)
     - classifies (*Intellectual Skill: Defined Concept*)
     - demonstrates (*Intellectual Skill: Rule*)
     - generates (*Intellectual Skill: Higher-order Rule or Problem Solving*)
     - originates (*Cognitive Strategy*)
     - states (*Verbal Information*)
     - executes (*Motor Skills*)
     - chooses (*Attitude*)
  * **Object:** the observable outcome
  * **Action:** by performing the observable activity
  * **(Optional) Tools and other constraints:** using the provided tools and procedures
       in a suitable manner.

In this framework, the major capability verbs reflect the corresponding domain
of learning. This is an alternative to Bloom's taxonomy.
