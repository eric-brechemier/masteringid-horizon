## Action Mapping to Reduce Donors Affected by Leaks to Less than 1,000/Year

### Subgoal: Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

#### Behavior: Keep track of where sensitive donor information is stored

##### Practice

* Find all files and databases where **donor names** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor emails** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor phone numbers** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donor addresses** are stored
* Find all files and databases where **credit card details** of donors are stored
* Find all files and databases where **bank details** of donors are stored
* Find all files and databases where **donation history** of donors is stored.

##### Minimum Information

* Where donor information is first stored when they provide it
* Who has access to donor information, and for what purpose
* Where donor information is stored for subsequent usage.

#### Behavior: Restrict access to sensitive donor information

##### Practice

* Prevent access to sensitive donor information from everyone for 24 hours

##### Minimum Information

* All the files and databases where donor information is stored
* Who needs access to donor information, when, and for what purpose
* How to prevent and authorize access to files and databases.

#### Behavior: Differentiate legitimate reasons to access sensitive information

##### Practice

Given a purpose, state orally whether this is a legitimate reason and why.
If the reason is not deemed legitimate, propose an alternative which does
not require access to sensitive donor information.

##### Minimum Information

* Criteria to evaluate legitimate reasons to access sensitive information
* List of alternatives, using anonymous or aggregate information.

### Subgoal: Prevent Exploitation of Employee Privileges Through Phishing

#### Behavior: Do not provide credentials to untrusted sources

##### Practice

Given an email received among other emails during a typical working day,
with a link to a login page which requests user credentials, but is not
stored on Horizon Intranet, the employee shall not input their credentials
in the page.

##### Minimum Information

* How to recognize that a Web page is stored on the Intranet
* Dangers of phishing.

#### Behavior: Do not run programs sent by untrusted sources

##### Practice

Given an email received among other emails during a typical working day,
with a link to download an executable file and instructions on how to run
it on the computer, the employee shall not run the executable.

##### Minimum Information

* What is an executable file
* How to answer prompts to allow an executable file to run
  in a way that prevents the executable from running.

#### Behavior: Report suspicious emails

##### Practice

Given an email received among other emails during a typical working day,
with telltale signs of an urgent or disproportionate request made by an
unknown contact or by a known contact in an unusual way, the employee
shall forward the email to the IT department for analysis.

##### Minimum Information

* Email of the IT deparment used to report suspicious emails
* Identify the claimed email address of the sender
* Awareness that the sender address can be spoofed
* Awareness that email of trusted contacts can be compromised
  (e.g. by a virus) to send emails pretending to originate from them
* Signs of a different voice (typography, syntax, level of language)
  used by a trusted source in a written email
* Signs of disproportionate requests or urgency

#### Behavior: Confirm unexpected requests received by email through a different channel

##### Practice

Given an email received among other emails during a typical working day,
received from a trusted colleague, with an unusual request to provide
sensitive information or financial details of donors, the employee shall
call the colleague to confirm the request before complying.

##### Minimum Information

* Identify requests that lead to disclose sensitive information about donors
* Identify requests that lead to disclose financial details of donors
