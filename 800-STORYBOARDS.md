The first storyboard presents a high-level, visual overview
of the learning experience for the first subgoal:

[Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors](#LINK-TO-STORYBOARD-1).

While this experience may be support by the development of e-learning
resources, we recommend to put the emphasis on hands-on activities
working with actual administration software and realistic data as much
as possible. For example, an activity may start with a presentation of the
concepts to learn, as self-paced e-learning or a few presentation slides.
It shall then continue with a practice activity to illustrate and experience
the concepts in play. We envision a ratio of 20% theory and 80% practice
for this course.
