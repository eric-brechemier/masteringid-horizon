## Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

[INSERT IMAGE OF PAGE 1 OF STORYBOARD #1 HERE]+LINK TO STORYBOARD #1

The first storyboard presents a high-level, visual overview
of the learning experience for the first subgoal:

[Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors](#LINK-TO-STORYBOARD-1).

While this experience may be support by the development of e-learning
resources, we recommend to put the emphasis on hands-on activities
working with actual administration software and realistic data as much
as possible. For example, an activity may start with a presentation of the
concepts to learn, as self-paced e-learning or a few presentation slides.
It shall then continue with a practice activity to illustrate and experience
the concepts in play. We envision a ratio of 20% theory and 80% practice
for this course.

In *The Conditions of Learning*, Robert M. Gagn√© describes 9 events
that support efficient learning. He lists them in the following order,
but remarks that the numbering only indicates *an approximate typical order*.
These events of instruction may occur in a different order and are not
necessarily present in every lesson:

  1. Gaining attention
  2. Informing learners of the objective
  3. Stimulating recall of prior learning
  4. Presenting the stimulus
  5. Providing learning guidance
  6. Eliciting performance
  7. Providing feedback
  8. Assessing performance
  9. Enhancing retention and transfer

We have found convenient to split these 9 events evenly into 3 groups which
correspond to three moments in a typical lesson: start, middle and end.

  * **Start**
    - 1\. Attention,
    - 3\. Prerequistes,
    - 2\. Performance Objective
  * **Middle**
    - 5\. Advanced Organizers,
    - 4\. Emphasized Stimulus,
    - 6\. Guided Performance
  * **End**
    - 7\. Close Feedback,
    - 8\. Assessment,
    - 9\. Generalization and Spaced Reviews.

The storyboard highlights the instructional events involved in the tests
that we designed to train Horizon workforce to fight phishing on the go.
You may notice that their order is atypical:

  * **Before: Instructional Phishing Email**
    - 9\. Generalization and Spaced Reviews,
    - 4\. Plain Stimulus, *Without* Emphasis,
    - 8\. Assessment

  * **After: Instructional Scam**
    - 1\. Attracting Attention,
    - 7\. Close Feedback,
    - 2\. Statement of Performance Objective.

That is because the goal of this particular training is to
**learn to notice the unexpected**. The emphasis usually given
to the content to be learned would prove detrimental for this
learning objective.
