## Instructional Strategies

The strategy underlying this effort will be to train employees and volunteers
on the job, as part of their daily activities. Our audience analysis has
highlighted a lack of time for dedicated training. Also, we wish to keep
the practice activities as close as possible to the real-life situations,
in order to maximize the efficiency of the training.

This training will be similar in principle to a vaccine. We will expose
our audience to realistic phishing emails, which will provide immediate
feedback about hazardous activities to the learner in case of mishap.
Instead of making the organization vulnerable, these training scams
will help to build its immunity.

We have identified a number of companies who advertise a service
sending innocuous phishing emails for training sake. Horizon may
choose to use one of these solutions off-the-shelf, to have one customized
to better accommodate the requirements of the projet, or to develop its own
training phishing solution, depending on the budget available.

We also recommend a number of efforts beyond this training in order
to trigger required changes in specific parts of the organization:

1. an update of internal policies on how to handle requests for sensitive
information or payments received by email. Any such request made by email
shall require a confirmation through a different channel, typically by phone.

2. an update of internal policies with regards to storage and copies of
files and databases containing sensitive donor information. Access to
personally identifiable information and payment details shall be restricted
on a need-to-know basis and treated in the same manner as SECRET or TOP SECRET
information in a military context.

These changes shall be reflected in existing training for affected employees.
