## Instructional Sequences

In order to address the two different sets of performance objectives,
we introduce two instructional sequences below, targeted at two different
audiences. The first sequence is dedicated to select IT specialists (10—100),
while the second one concerns a very large group (50,000–100,000)
including all employees and volunteers part of the organization.

The first sequence is planned for a typical learning period of 5 weeks,
while the second sequence is expected to span several years.

### Module 1: How to Prevent Access to Sensitive Information of Donors

1–2 hours per week over 5 weeks.

#### Week 1


#### Week 2


#### Week 3


#### Week 4


#### Week 5


### Module 2: Gone Phishing

Each learner will receive 1 email every 5 to 10 days, at random intervals.
The roll-out will be progressive starting with a few hundred learners,
including all the learning champions in the first month, and adding several
thousand employees and volunteers each month. The progress of each learner will
be tracked individually to adjust the level of the challenges accordingly,
across the 3 levels of difficulty.

#### Level 1: Each email contains several obvious signs of scam

* phishing for credentials through visibly fake URL
* phishing through attached executable program
* obvious scam scheme requesting an urgent payment from the learner

#### Level 2: Each email contains only one obvious sign of scam

* phishing for credentials through masked URL
* phishing through attached spreadsheet with macros
* scam scheme requesting an urgent payment to a unknown organization,
  from a known contact but sent from a free email provider

#### Level 3: Each email is suspicious without any obvious sign of scam

* phishing for credentials through a page which loads a login page only once hidden
* phishing through an email pretending to contain instructions from Horizon IT
  to download a zip archive and install a new program on the computer
* scam scheme requesting a list of donor emails for fundraising purpose,
  sent from the email address of an existing employee
