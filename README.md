# Horizon Project
Instructional Design Project part of Mastering ID Master Class  
lead by Connie Malamed in January-February 2021

## Project Summary

The client for this fictitious project is a non-profit organization
called the Horizon Foundation, which has suffered from a loss of reputation
last year when personal information for 45,000 donors was leaked.

The source of the data leak was identified as a phishing attack which
allowed attackers to gain access to the private network of the organization.

Besides the security audit, the Horizon Foundation wishes to deploy an
internal training to help its 50,000 employees to recognize potential
phishing attempts and successfully steer clear of them in the future.
