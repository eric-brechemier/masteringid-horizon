# Evidence-Based Strategies

Our design can take advantage of the following principles,
based on available research about learning.


## Effortful Learning

*Learning is deeper and more durable when itâ€™s effortful.*

## Retrieval Practice

*Retrieving verbal information from memory is more efficient than rereading.*

## Spaced Practice

*Reviewing verbal information after an interval of time improves retention.*

## Elaboration

*Memorization can be enhanced by linking new facts to existing knowledge.*

## Scaffolding

*Learning benefits from explicit guidance, which can decrease over time.*

# How can we use these principles in our design?
